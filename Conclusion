# Conclusion
Based on the PCA results, it shows that using only 7 PCA components has obtained the power of 94.92% of information so there is no need to look for a PC for the remaining data. But in this case, if you use a PC less than 7, the value will be below 90% so the accuracy of the data will be reduced.
